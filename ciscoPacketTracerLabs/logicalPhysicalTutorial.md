_notes/what I learned from this tutorial_

### cable selection
The blue cable (console cable, roll-over) is is primarily used for console connections to network devices such as routers and switches for configuration use cases. In this tutorial, the PC connects to the router

The green cable (straight through) is used for connecting different network devices (e.g., computer to switch) and follows a consistent wiring scheme on both ends. _For the case of connecting PC to router, both cables can be used but the rollover is used for console management whereas a straight through is used for network connection._

In newer hardware, console to pc connections can be made through USB.

Console configurations are modified through CLI and can be made remotely through SSH.
